### Hello!

My name is Sally. Iâ€™m a computer science student at the University of Waterloo. I'm driven by passion, curiosity, and lots of milk tea! In my spare time, I enjoy reading and experimenting with design. I'm currently trying to figure out virtual learning and looking for new opportunities. Feel free to check out some of my projects :)
